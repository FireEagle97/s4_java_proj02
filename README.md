# E-Wallet Application

## Overview

This is a GUI application that functions as a digital wallet (or E-wallet). Users can see how much cash ($) they have, how many cards they have, and keep track of important notes they have, like a normal wallet would function. Users can Add/Remove cards (both debit and credit) and notes. When users create cards, they must specify between credit/debit and the limit on those cards. Users can make payments on their cards, where information is displayed on the screen if there is a message (50% limit reached, not enough funds). Users can Save/Load an existing wallet.

This application uses Java and JavaFX with Maven.
